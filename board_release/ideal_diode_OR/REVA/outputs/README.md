* Ideal Diode PCB
    
     * Intended to be an efficient way to "Diode OR" multilpe batteries together in parallel. However, traditional diode OR'ing results in a relatively large power drop across the diodes. This design uses an LTC4359 Ideal Diode Controller with Reverse Input Protection. The controller drives external N-Channel MOSFETs to replace a traditional Schottky Diode



* Ideal Diode PCB Enclosure
    
     * PCB enclosure that contains the ideal diode PCB, 12V regulator and a 12-24V Boost converter
    
     * Mechanical enclosure is a relatively compact 3D printed enclosure. The primary system components are secured by heat set inserts.
 
    * Harnessing goes out to the D-SUB connectors on the outside of the box
.
         * This setup shows why we avoid routing to connectors mounted to the outside of boxes and we avoided internal box harnessing on our other PCB modules.
