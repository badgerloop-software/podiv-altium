# Badgerloop Libraries

## How to add a part video:
https://youtu.be/r89xm_44ldI

## Schematics Requirements:
1. Correct library (capacitor, resistor, connector...)
2. Descriptive and searchable Design ID?
3. Link to component on digikey?
4. Default designator set?
5. 100 Mil Snap Grid? 
6. Pin Maps are correct
7. Are pins grouped in a logical way? 
8. Does the part symbol make sense for the specific part? 
9. Is your part linked to a PCB Footprint?
10. Is your part linked to a 3D Model? 

## PCB Footprint Requirements:
1. Are you following the datasheet's recommended PCB footprint guidelines? 
2. Does your silkscreen make sense? Is it descriptive, but still small? 
3. Do you have enough clearance between adjacent pads, vias, PTH, etc.
4. Are you following the datasheet's recommended PCB footprint guidelines?
5. Do your pads have enough room to solder onto? 
6. Check your layers, are you working primarily on the top side? 
7. Did you check your real-world component dimensions with calipers?
8. What is your snap grid?
